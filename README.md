# Authentication-System
 The
system authenticates a user, a client, and a server that are part of client-server software.
The system uses SSL, authentication tokens, and features advantages such as reusability,
ease of use and integration, and complete security. Since the user login is a separate
component, the system does not need to address the technical and ethical issues of
authenticating users. This is one of the many features of the system that make it
appropriate to student and faculty projects.
